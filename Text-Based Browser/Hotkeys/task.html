<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Every browser has a “back” button. If the user presses this button, the browser shows the previous web page. This feature can be realized using a stack. You save the pages visited by the user: google, wikipedia, bloomberg, but when the user types <code class="java">back</code>, you will see the last visited pages in the reverse order: wikipedia, google. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>The functionality of the program is the same as in the previous task, but now the program has a new feature:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The program should show the previous web page saved to a file if the user's input is the string <code class="java">back</code>. Note that the <em>last </em>page you saved to a file is considered to be the <em>current </em>page, and when input is the string <code class="java">back</code>, you should output the page that was <em>before </em>the current one. You can implement a stack to do this (but the current page shouldn't be put in the stack). For example, if the user inputs <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code>, then <code class="java">nytimes.com</code>, then <code class="java">back</code>, after the command <code class="java">back</code> the content of the web page <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code> should be printed. </li>
	<li>If there are no more pages in the browser history, don’t output anything. For example, if the first input of the user is the string <code class="java">back</code>, your program shouldn't output anything. </li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
