<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's make our browser store web pages in a file and show them if the user types a shortened request (for example, wikipedia instead of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wikipedia.org</a>). You can store each page as a separate file or find another way to do this. But your program should accept one command line argument which is a directory to store the files, and your web pages should be saved inside this directory.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>At this stage, your program should: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Accept a command-line argument which is a directory for saved tabs. For example, if the argument is <code class="java">dir</code>, then you need to create a folder with the name <code class="java">dir</code> and save all the web pages that the user downloads in this folder.</li>
	<li>Read the user's input specifying URL. Check if this URL is valid: firstly, it should contain at least one dot, for example, <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code> (while <code class="java">bloombergcom</code> is invalid). If the URL is incorrect, the browser should output an error message (it should contain the word <code class="java">error</code>) and wait for another URL.</li>
	<li>Secondly, in this task, your program can only access two web pages: <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code> and <code class="java">nytimes.com</code>. If the URL isn't any of these links, your program should output an error message too. </li>
	<li>If the URL is valid, print the content of the web page and save it to a file in the aforementioned directory (you have two predefined variables with the content of the web pages that you should save: <code class="java">bloomberg_com</code> and <code class="java">nytimes_com</code>). The name of the file should correspond to the web page name. To get the name of the file, remove the last dot and everything that comes after it. This way, the file for the page <code class="java">bloomberg.com</code> will be named <code class="java">bloomberg</code>.</li>
	<li>Read the next input. If this input is the string <code class="java">exit</code>, the program should stop running. If not, check if the string corresponds to the name of any file with a web page you saved before. If it does, print the content of this file. If it doesn't, check if the string is a new valid URL. If it is, repeat step 4. If it isn't, output an error message. </li>
</ol>

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
