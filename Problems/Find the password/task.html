  <p>Imagine that you are a hacker and you've got access to a web server written in Python. The problem is that it asks for a password which you don't know. However, this server is open source so you know that there is a <code class="language-python">wrong_password()</code> function which takes a password and checks it against <code class="language-python">real_password</code>.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def wrong_password(password):
    return (password == "" or (not password and real_password)) or password != real_password</code></pre> 
  <p>You can access this function. Write your code inside the <code class="language-python">solve()</code> function: find the <code class="language-python">real_password</code> and <strong>print </strong>it. Your program shouldn't read any input or call the function, just implement it.</p>
